msgid "The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager optionally includes a comprehensive management history database, which can be utilized by any application to extract a range of information at the data center, cluster, and host levels. As the database structure changes over time a number of database views are also included to provide a consistent structure to consuming applications. A view is a virtual table composed of the result set of a database query. The definition of a view is stored in the database as a <literal>SELECT</literal> statement. The result set of the <literal>SELECT</literal> statement populates the virtual table returned by the view. If the optional comprehensive management history database has been enabled, the history tables and their associated views are stored in the <systemitem>rhevm_history</systemitem> database."
