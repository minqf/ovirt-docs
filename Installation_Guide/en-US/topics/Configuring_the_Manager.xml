	<title>Configuring Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager</title>
	<para>
		Once package installation is complete the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager must be configured. The <command>rhevm-setup</command> command is provided to assist with this task. The script asks you a series of questions, the answers to which form the basis for system configuration. Once all required values have been provided the updated configuration is applied and the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager services are started.

			<title>Override Apache configuration</title>
			<para>
				Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization uses the <systemitem>mod_proxy</systemitem> module for the Apache web server (<systemitem>httpd</systemitem>) to redirect network traffic from the <acronym>HTTP</acronym> and <acronym>HTTPS</acronym> ports which you select, to the application server that the Manager runs on. If the <command>rhevm-setup</command> script detects an existing <systemitem>httpd</systemitem> configuration then you will need to decide whether or not to override it:

			<title>Set Port for <acronym>HTTP</acronym></title>
			<para>
				The script prompts for entry of the port to use for <acronym>HTTP</acronym> communication. To use the default value, <literal>80</literal>, press <keycap> Enter</keycap>. To use an alternative value enter it in the field, and then press <keycap> Enter</keycap>.

			<title>Set Fully Qualified Domain Name (<acronym>FQDN</acronym>)</title>
			<para>
				The script prompts for entry of the system's fully qualified domain name. This name should be resolvable via both forward and reverse <acronym> DNS</acronym> lookup. The script attempts to determine the fully qualified domain name automatically. The value identified is listed in square brackets as the default setting for the fully qualified domain name, based on your setup.

			<title>Set Administrator Password</title>
			<para>
				The script creates an authentication domain internal to the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager for the default administrative account. The domain is named <systemitem> internal</systemitem>, the administrative user is called <systemitem> admin</systemitem>. External authentication domains are added as a post-installation step using the <command>rhevm-manage-domains</command> command.
			</para>
			<para>
				You must choose a password for the <systemitem class="username"> admin</systemitem> user. You will be asked to enter it a second time to confirm your selection.
			</para>
			<screen>Password for Administrator (admin@internal) :</screen>
		</step>

			<title>Set Organization Name</title>
			<para>

			</para>
			<screen>Organization Name for the Certificate :</screen>
		</step>
		<step>
			<title>Configure Default Storage Type</title>
			<para>
				The script prompts for selection of the default storage type. This is the storage type that is used for the <literal>Default</literal> data center. You are able to add further data centers that use different storage types from the Administration Portal at any time.
			</para>
			<screen>The default storage type you will be using  ['NFS'| 'FC'| 'ISCSI']  [NFS] :</screen>

				</itemizedlist> The <literal>NFS</literal>, <literal>FC</literal>, and <literal>ISCSI</literal> options are used to connect to remote storage. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization also supports The <literal>LOCALFS</literal> storage type which allows the use of local storage attached to the virtualization hosts, but this storage type is not supported for the <literal>Default</literal> data center.
			</para>
			<para>
				To use the default selection, <literal>NFS</literal>, press <keycap> Enter</keycap>. To select <literal>FC</literal>, or <literal>ISCSI</literal> then enter the value and then press <keycap> Enter</keycap>.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<title>Select database location</title>
			<para>
				Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization supports the use of a local database on the management system, or a remote database provided elsewhere in your environment. The setup script prompts you to indicate whether you wish to use a local database, which is the default option, or a remote database:
			</para>
			<screen>Enter DB type for installation ['remote'| 'local']  [local] :</screen>
			<stepalternatives>
				<step>
					<para>
						Enter <literal>local</literal> to have the setup script create a local Postgresql database server for the Manager.
					</para>

						The script prompts for entry of a password to use for the local Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager database. Enter the desired password. You will be asked to enter the password again to confirm it.
					</para>
					<screen>Database password (required for secure authentication with the locally created database) :</screen>

			<title>Configure NFS ISO Domain</title>
			<para>
				The script asks whether or not an <acronym> NFS</acronym> share should be configured on the server and used as an <acronym> ISO</acronym> storage domain.
			</para>
			<screen>Should the installer configure NFS share on this server to be used as an ISO Domain? ['yes'| 'no']  [yes] :</screen>
			<para>
				An <acronym> ISO</acronym> storage domain is used to store copies of removable media for use when provisioning and using virtual machines. The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager is able to use either an <acronym> ISO</acronym> storage domain on the system it is installed to or one that exists on remote storage. In either case the <acronym> ISO</acronym> storage domain must be accessible via <acronym> NFS</acronym>. The ability to configure an <acronym> ISO</acronym> storage domain is also available from the Administration Portal after installation.
			</para>
			<para>
				To take the default action, which is to configure an <acronym> NFS</acronym> share for use as an <acronym> ISO</acronym> storage domain, press <keycap> Enter</keycap>. To skip this step type <literal>no</literal> and press <keycap> Enter</keycap>.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you chose to configure an <acronym> NFS</acronym> share then you will also need to provide both a path and a display name for it. The path is the location on the local file system where the <acronym> NFS</acronym> share must be created. The directory must not already exist.
			</para>
			<screen>Mount point path:</screen>
			<para>
				The display name is the name the storage domain will appear under in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. The display name must not contain non-alphanumeric characters other than the underscore (<literal>_</literal>) and the hyphen (<literal>-</literal>).
			</para>
			<screen>Display name for the ISO domain:</screen>
			<para>
				The <acronym> ISO</acronym> domain will be created and exported as an <acronym> NFS</acronym> share. It will be shown as active in the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager once the first active virtualization host has been added to the <literal>Default</literal> data center.
			</para>
		</step>
		<step>
			<title>Configure Firewall</title>
			<para>
				The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager requires that network traffic on a number of ports be allowed through the system's firewall. The <command>rhevm-setup</command> script is able to configure this automatically, but selecting this option overrides any existing firewall configuration. Where there is an existing firewall configuration that needs to be maintained you must manually configure the firewall to include the additional rules required by the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager.
			</para>
			<screen>
Firewall ports need to be opened.
You can let the installer configure iptables automatically overriding the current configuration. The old configuration will be backed up.
Alternately you can configure the firewall later using an example iptables file found under /usr/share/ovirt-engine/conf/iptables.example
Configure iptables ? ['yes'| 'no']:

					</para>
				</step>
				<step>
					<para>
						To skip automatic firewall configuration type <literal>no</literal> and then press <keycap> Enter</keycap>. You will need to add rules equivalent to those found in <filename>/usr/share/ovirt-engine/conf/iptables.example</filename> to your <command>iptables</command> configuration.
					</para>
				</step>
			</stepalternatives>
		</step>
		<step>
			<title>Confirm Configuration</title>
			<para>
				You have now provided the script with all the information required to complete configuration of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager. The values which you entered are displayed for confirmation.
