	<title>Data Collection Setup and Reports Installation Overview</title>
	<para>
		The Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager optionally includes a comprehensive management history database, which can be utilized by any application to extract a range of information at the data center, cluster, and host levels. As the database structure changes over time a number of database views are also included to provide a consistent structure to consuming applications. A view is a virtual table composed of the result set of a database query. The definition of a view is stored in the database as a <literal>SELECT</literal> statement. The result set of the <literal>SELECT</literal> statement populates the virtual table returned by the view. If the optional comprehensive management history database has been enabled, the history tables and their associated views are stored in the <systemitem>rhevm_history</systemitem> database.
	</para>
	<para>
		In addition to the history database Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports functionality is also available as an optional component. Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports provides a customized implementation of JasperServer, and JasperReports. JasperServer is a component of JasperReports, an open source reporting tool capable of being embedded in Java-based applications. It produces reports which can be rendered to screen, printed, or exported to a variety of formats including <acronym> PDF</acronym>, Excel, <acronym> CSV</acronym>, Word, <acronym> RTF</acronym>, Flash, <acronym> ODT</acronym> and <acronym> ODS</acronym>. Reports built in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager Reports are accessed via a web interface. In addition to a range of pre-configured reports and dashboards for monitoring the system, you are also able to create your own ad hoc reports.
