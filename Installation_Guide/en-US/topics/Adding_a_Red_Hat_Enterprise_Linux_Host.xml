	<title>Adding a Fedora Host</title>
	<para>
		A Fedora host is based on an standard installation of Fedora.
	</para>
	<para>
		ovirt-engine hosts are based on a customized disk image with just enough Fedora for virtualization. They are approved rather than added.
	</para>
	<para>
		To add a Fedora host, provide some details about it. The Manager logs into the host to perform virtualization checks, install packages, create a network bridge and reboot the host. The process of adding a new host can take up to 10 minutes. The process can be followed in the host's details pane.
