	<para>
		Where the Node was configured with the address of the oVirt Engine it reboots and is automatically registered with it. The oVirt Engine interface displays the Node under the <application>Hosts</application> tab. To prepare the Node for use, it must be approved using oVirt Engine.
	</para>
	<para>
		Where the Node was configured without the address of the oVirt Engine it needs to be added manually. To add the Node manually you must have both the IP address of the machine upon which it was installed and the password that was set on the <guilabel>OVIRT</guilabel> screen during configuration.
