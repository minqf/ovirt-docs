	<title>Installing the Node Interactively</title>
	<para>
		oVirt Nodes are able to use Storage Area Networks (<acronym>SANs</acronym>) and other network storage for storing virtualized guest images. Nodes can be installed on <acronym> SANs</acronym>, provided that the Host Bus Adapter (<acronym>HBA</acronym>) permits configuration as a boot device in <acronym> BIOS</acronym>.
	</para>
	<para>
		Hypervisors are able to use multipath devices for installation. Multipath is often used for <acronym>SANs</acronym> or other networked storage. Multipath is enabled by default at install time. Any block device which responds to <command>scsi_id</command> functions with multipath. Devices where this is not the case include <acronym> USB</acronym> storage and some older <acronym> ATA</acronym> disks.

			<title>Disk Configuration</title>

						The first disk selection screen is used to select the disk from which the Node will boot. the Node's boot loader will be installed to the Master Boot Record ( <acronym> MBR</acronym>) of the disk that is selected on this screen. the Node attempts to automatically detect the disks attached to the system and presents the list from which you choose the boot device. Alternatively you are able to manually select a device, by specifying a block device name, by enabling the <guilabel>Other Device</guilabel> option.
