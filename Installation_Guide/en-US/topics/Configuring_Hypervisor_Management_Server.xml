		the Node is able to attach itself to the oVirt Engine immediately if the address of the Manager is available. Where the Manager has not yet been installed you must instead set a password. This allows the Node to be added from the Administration Portal once the Manager has been installed. Both modes of configuration are supported from the <guilabel>OVIRT</guilabel> screen in the Node user interface.

			Setting a password on the <guilabel>ovirt-engine</guilabel> configuration screen sets the Node's <systemitem>root</systemitem> password and enables <acronym>SSH</acronym> password authentication. Once the Node has successfully been added to the Manager it is recommended <acronym>SSH</acronym> password authentication is disabled.
